1. Create a new object<br>
2. Check its <i>door</i> check box.<br>
3. Connect it to two rooms<br>
4. Set its parent to the room where you want the door to appear.<br>

<b>Making a door that appears in 2 rooms.</b><br>
(This would be like the kitchen window in Zork, which you can open or close the window from either the kitchen or from behind the house).
<br>
This can be achieved using an Event to place the door in the player's current location.<br>
<br>
<pre>
if (player.holder == room1)
{
	wooden door.holder = room1;
}
else if (player.holder == room2)
{
	wooden door.holder = room2;
}
</pre>
